<li>GALEO has won a New Zealand Institute of Surveyors Award of Excellence for Sustainability.
<li>We built our home with a company that emphasises sustainability.</li>
<li>We have 16 solar panels on the roof and feed back to the grid. We also use a local power company who uses any excess profits to give back to the local community.</li>
<li>Because our sub-division has its own sewage system, we only use biodegradable cleaning products.</li>
<li>We recycle glass, plastics and metals.</li>
