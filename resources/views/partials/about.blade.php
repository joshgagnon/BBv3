<p>Welcome to our beautiful contemporary country home situated on top of a ridge at 114 Redvale Rd, in the award winning GALEO Estate, Tasman, South Island, New Zealand. In building our home we
thought about health, well-being and impact on the environment so incorporated many eco
features. The views from our home are simply stunning, taking in the Western Ranges,
Tasman Bay out to D’Urville Island and at night the twinkling lights of Nelson.</p>
<p>Being between the thriving town of Richmond and the beautiful coastal village of Mapua, we
are surrounded by wineries, craft breweries, artists and food producers and are close to the
popular coastal section of the Tasman Great Taste Trail and the beautiful Moturoa/Rabbit
Island Beach and Recreation area. We are also centrally located between Nelson and Motueka
– approximately 20 mins to each.</p>

<p>Our rural sub-division is known for its bird life and here you will see Pukeko, quail, ducks,
plover, swallows, kingfisher, low flying hawks and in increasing numbers our wonderful
native birds such as the fantail and tui.</p>
<p>There are a number of cafes and restaurants within a short distance including the wonderful
Playhouse Café and Theatre. We also offer an optional tasting platter on the night of
arrival.</p>
<p>We are happy to share with you our love of New Zealand and especially the south island and
help you make plans for all the wonderful things to do and see in this area; we can also assist with bookings.
